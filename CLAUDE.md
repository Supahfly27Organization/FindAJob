# CLAUDE.md

## Working Rules
- Response style (conversational narration and status updates only — see exemptions below):
  - Lead with the result; no pleasantries, preamble, or restatement of the request.
  - Do not narrate routine tool calls (routine codebase-memory-mcp lookups, file reads, standard edits).
  - Do not repeat unchanged plans or previously reported findings — reference them instead of restating.
  - During implementation, report only important discoveries, blockers, or decisions.
  - Final response on a coding task: outcome, changed files, tests run, unresolved issues — nothing else.
  - Match length to the task, not a fixed cap. Always preserve technical caveats, commands, paths, numbers, and error messages, even if it lengthens the response.
  - Exempt from the above: PRDs, discovery docs, story lists, roadmaps, brainstorming option analysis, User Review Gate content, and any skill-defined output format (e.g. ReportFindings). Size these to the content, not to brevity.
- When implementing, write code directly — skip preamble.
- Do not re-read files already in context.
- Read only files directly needed for the current task; never explore the codebase broadly before starting — prefer querying codebase-memory-mcp over generic file search for navigation once this repo is indexed (see `docs/claude/KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS.md`).
- Only invoke Superpowers / Product Superpowers skills when explicitly named (slash command or direct request). Do not speculatively invoke skills based on topical relevance.
- Before invoking a plugin skill by name, confirm it's present in the current skill listing — if it's missing, stop and ask whether to enable it (`claude plugin enable <plugin>@<marketplace>` then `/clear`) rather than manually reproducing its process as a workaround.
- Knowledge/navigation/editing tool policy (Codebase Memory MCP, serena, file-read discipline): see `docs/claude/KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS.md`.
- Subagent model selection — always pass an explicit model param when dispatching; never omit it and rely on inheritance (it silently inherits the session's most expensive model):
  - When dispatching through `subagent-driven-development` (Superpowers) or `pm-autonomous-execution` (Product Superpowers), follow that skill's own Model Selection section — do not duplicate or drift from it.
  - For everything else (aeco's own `github-issue-*` skills, MCP-driven mechanical work, and standalone gates not normally dispatched like `brainstorming`/`writing-plans`/`product-discovery`/`writing-prd`/`pm-artifact-review`): cheap/fast model for mechanical, low-ambiguity tasks; mid-tier (the default) for bounded implementation/analysis work; most capable model for decisions later work depends on and can't easily undo (architecture, strategy, final review).
- Module documentation — keep each project/module's `CLAUDE.md` accurate as part of the same change that touches it (add, update, or delete content — it should never just accumulate):
  - Architecture: structure, entry points, key dependencies.
  - Non-obvious decisions: why something is built the way it is, invariants, gotchas — skip anything already obvious from reading the code.
  - Playbook (when the module has recurring multi-step procedures, e.g. "how to add an endpoint here"): a terse `## Playbook` section with the steps. This is module-scoped and separate from CASS Memory's auto-learned playbook (`docs/claude/KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS.md`) — don't conflate the two.

## What is FindAJob?

an application to help me find a job. It should look the internet for specific positions, Present them to me, for each position viewed it should mentioned viewed. It should adapt my resume to the position and save it when i apply the position.

Tech: Node.js

## Task → Read These First

<!-- Fill this in as the codebase grows: map common tasks to the files/docs that should be
     read first. This is the highest-leverage section in this file — it's what turns a
     generic agent into one that knows this codebase's shape. -->

| Task | Read These |
|------|-----------|
| Add/change a backend endpoint or service | `server/CLAUDE.md` |
| Add/change a frontend page or API client | `client/CLAUDE.md` |
| Security / quality review | `docs/claude/SCANNING_TOOLS.md` |

## Security & Quality Scanning

Three tools, each with a primary purpose:
- **SonarQube** — code quality, bugs, maintainability, coverage, technical debt
- **Semgrep** — source-code security patterns (injection, XSS, auth, secrets in code)
- **Trivy** — dependency CVEs, Docker images, IaC, secrets in config/repo files

For decision rules, overlap cases, scan order, and token discipline: `docs/claude/SCANNING_TOOLS.md`

## GitHub Integration

The `github` MCP server (`mcp__github__*`) is always configured — general GitHub operations (issues, PRs, review comments, code/issue search) are available regardless of which optional features were enabled during `aeco init`. If `.claude/skills/github-issue-{sync,start,commit}/` exist (only added when the GitHub Issue Workflow was enabled), use those dedicated skills for the tracked-issue workflow instead of hand-rolling the same steps.

## Repo Rules

1. There is no migrations folder — `server/src/db/schema.sql` is the single source of schema truth, applied idempotently on every startup.
2. Preserve existing project names and namespaces when refactoring.
3. Frontend commands run from `client/`, backend commands run from `server/`; use the root `npm run dev` / `npm start` / `npm test` scripts to operate on both at once.

## Local DB Defaults

| DB | Connection String |
|---|---|
| SQLite (local file) | `server/data/findajob.db` (created automatically on first run; override with `FINDAJOB_DB_PATH`) |
